# Planned Project Status at Current Deadline  
  * Basic Enemy AI working  
  * Alpha version of first level completed (not including obstacles & traps)    
    * This level should be winnable  
  * Shooting and bullet interactions with level objects and in-game characters completed  

# Current Project Status (Accomplishments at Deadline)  
  * Player mobility (including double jump and wall jump) working  
  * Alpha version of first level completed  
  * Directional shooting and bullet interactions with level objects working  
### Incomplete Tasks and Explanation  
  * Enemy AI started but simple
  * First level is currently not winnable  

*Explanation:*  
Midway through this development block, we decided to switch our development  
platform to Unity. This decision was made because though Unreal Engine 4  
is far more powerful, most of the required functionality is pre-built into  
the engine. We investigated the possibility of simply writing our own  
versions of these methods; however to do so would require far too much  
time as these methods are implemented in multiple layers to allow proper  
use within the engine. This decision did come at a cost however. We  
now had to port all of our previous development into the Unity engine  
which limited the amount of time that we could spend dedicated to implementing  
new functionality.  


# Planned Project Status at Next Deadline (Bold Entries Signify Incomplete Tasks From Previous Deadlines)  
  * Enemy AI fleshed out, aim for 2 different types of enemies, one that hovers and shoots, one that runs into Player
  * More level traps, add more things for player to interact with and avoid, aim for 2 or 3 more traps/obstacles
  * Flesh out player shooting and bullet interactions
  * Start UI for game.
  * flesh out first level, start and try to finish second level.
