*Explanation:*  
....Midway through this development block, we decided to switch our development  
platform to Unity. This descision was made because though Unreal Engine 4  
is far more powerful, most of the required functionality is pre-built into  
the engine. We investigated the possibility of simply writing our own  
versions of these methods; however to do so would require far too much  
time as these methods are implemented in multiple layers to allow proper  
use within the engine. This descision did come at a cost however. We  
now had to port all of our previous development into the Unity engine  
which limited the amount of time that we could spend dedicated to implementing  
new functionality.
