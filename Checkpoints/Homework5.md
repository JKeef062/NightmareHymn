### Lessons Learned & Future Improvements
  * level 2 not fully complete
  * charging ai not, bug with constraints  
  * boss ai is difficult and takes a lot of time

  *Explanation:*  
     with classes moving online productivity took a little bit of a hit while trying to adjust, also it made meeting to work on issues together harder. We have figured out a time to meet on discord during the week so we should not have too much difficulty working together.
