# Planned Project Status at Current Deadline  
* One Enemy AI fully done and fleshed out(floating turret ai)
* multiple level traps, falling platforms, sawblade, death trap all done
* player shooting fleshed out now usable with mouse and bullet interactions done!
* Start menu UI and HUD started and functionality done, new changes are aesthetic
* level pretty much done both mechanically and aesthetically lvl 2 plan to work on during next meeting day
* boss for level one in testing phase

# Current Project Status (Accomplishments at Deadline)  


### Lessons Learned & Future Improvements 
  * level 2 not fully complete
  * charging ai not done


  *Explanation:*  
     with classes moving online productivity took a little bit of a hit while trying to adjust, also it made meeting to work on issues together harder. We have figured out a time to meet on discord during the week so we should not have too much difficulty working together.
    
# Final Functionality  
![Turret AI and Killing Enemies](https://github.com/OdinsWrath/NightmareHymn_Development/tree/master/Deadline_GIFs/TurretAI_BulletInteraction.gif)   
This simple AI has the floating turret follow the players location until it is within a certain distance that it begins shooting at the player. The code for this behavior can be seen in the 'Assets/Scripts/Enemies/floatingTurretEnemy.cs' script. It simply has a reference to the players current game location and moves at the specified speed towards the player using a vector that constantly points at the player.  

![Saw Blade Instant Death](https://github.com/OdinsWrath/NightmareHymn_Development/tree/master/Deadline_GIFs/RotatingInstantDeathTrap.gif)  
This death trap orbits around its initial location with a specified width and height. This allows the orbit to be manipulated to be any ellipse that is required for its placement. If its collider connects with the player, a signal is sent to the telling the game that the player has died and to respawn them at the beginning of the level. The code for this behavior can be seen in the 'Assets/Scripts/Enemies/Saw.cs' file.  

![360 Shooting Using the Mouse](https://github.com/OdinsWrath/NightmareHymn_Development/tree/master/Deadline_GIFs/FullDirectionalShooting.gif)   
We have updated the player shooting direction to be the direction of the mouses location on the screen relative to the players current location. The full 360 rotation of direction is achieved using an inivisible sphere object that is a child of the Player. This sphere has a child 3D vector that is located at the edge of it's radius. Then shooting vector is calculated as the difference between the mouse's in-game location and the current player location. The sphere is then rotated such that the firepoint vector always follows the x-component of this firepoint vector. Then a shooting action is triggered by a left click event being sent to the game UI manager. The code for this can be seen in the 'Assets/Scripts/Player/Weapon.cs' script.  


![Falling Platform Death](https://github.com/OdinsWrath/NightmareHymn_Development/tree/master/Deadline_GIFs/FallingPlatform.gif)   
This is achieved by simply making collision with the player trigger the effects of gravity on the platform. The implementation of this behavior can be see in the 'Assets/Sctips/FallingPlatform.cs' script.  


![Lv1 Beta Playthrough](https://github.com/OdinsWrath/NightmareHymn_Development/tree/master/Deadline_GIFs/DiscoInferno_Lv1_FullRunthrough.gif)  
This is a full playthrough of the beta versio of our first level. This illustrates all of the work and functionality that has been fully implemented up to this point. There is more functionality that we have in the works, like the final boss fight in this level; but it is not in a working state at the moment.  

![Start Menu and Options Menu Navigation](https://github.com/OdinsWrath/NightmareHymn_Development/tree/master/Deadline_GIFs/MenuNavigation.gif)   
This navigation is handled in a very similar manner as Qt creator. A function is attached to the specific buttons that defines its behavior, like a slot. This slot constantly listens for an event to trigger, generated by the user clicking within the buttons bounds. Once this signal is received, the function listening for that specific signal executes, in this case loading other menu screens or levels, and then returns the game to the necessary listening mode (signal listenting for UI, or input event listening in level).
